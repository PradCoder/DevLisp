## Further steps
I'm planning on using what I've done hear to implement a completely new language on my own.

## To be implemented
- Native Types
- User Defined Types
- List Literal
- Operating System interaction
- Macros
- Variable Hashtable
- Pool Allocation
- Garbage Collection
- Tail Call Optimisation
- Lexical Scoping
- Static Typing and more....
